# Sparse N-Dimensional Arrays

This is a (still incomplete) implementation of Sparse N-Dimensional Arrays based off of GSL's SPMatrix.

## Roadmap:
### Operations
- [X] allocate
- [X] free
- [X] get
- [ ] get variadic
- [X] set
- [ ] set variadic
- [X] IncrementAt
- [X] Fill value

### Arithmetic
- [X] Addition
- [X] Subtraction
- [X] Simple Multiplication
- [X] map 1/x
- [ ] Multiplication with nonzero fill values
- [X] reduce one dimension by a given funcion

### Memory Operations
- [X] copy
- [ ] CCS compress

### Fancy Operations
- [X] Extraction of dimensions
- [ ] Reshape
- [ ] Flatten
- [ ] Partition
- [ ] Subarray extract
- [ ] Views
