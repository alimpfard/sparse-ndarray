# Sparse N-Dimensional Arrays

This is a (still incomplete) implementation of Sparse N-Dimensional Arrays based off of GSL's SPMatrix.

#### Things implemented:
    + alloc/free
    + get/set/ptr

#### Roadmap:
## Operations
- [ ] IncrementAt

## Arithmetic
- [ ] Addition / Subtraction
- [ ] Multiplication (research how to multiply spaces)
- [ ] reduce one dimension by a given funcion

## Memory Operations
- [ ] copy
- [ ] CCS compress
