# Sparse N-Dimensional Arrays

This is a (still incomplete) implementation of Sparse N-Dimensional Arrays based off of GSL's SPMatrix.

## Roadmap:
### Operations
- [X] allocate
- [X] free
- [X] get
- [ ] get variadic
- [X] set
- [ ] set variadic
- [X] IncrementAt

### Arithmetic
- [ ] Addition
- [ ] Subtraction
- [ ] Multiplication (research how to multiply spaces)
- [X] reduce one dimension by a given funcion

### Memory Operations
- [ ] copy
- [ ] CCS compress
